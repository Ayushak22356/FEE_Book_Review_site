<h2>1.Harry Potter and the Order of Phoenix</h2>
<h3>Author:J.K.Rowling</h3>
<h4>Rating:4/5</h4>
<p>This is my favourite Harry Potter book and my favourite movie that followed, the amazing writing skills displayed by J.K Rowling, the classic personality of Harry, Ron, Hermione, and characters from the Order of the Phoenix, the addition of Luna, the toad known as Dolores Umbridge, the new Defence against the Dark Arts teacher, and more amazing characters.
    I think the scenes are amazingly portrayed to the movie that follows. Really just a great book that in my opinion is the best work of J.K Rowling.This book is AMAZING along with the other books. The plot is filled with excitement, and I can't put the book down. No matter how tired I am, I always stay up late reading this because I'm in the middle of a good part, but  EVERY PART is a GOOD part!!! .This is such a good book. It is a bit long at 870 pages, but I loved every single page of this book. The way Harry feels is portrayed perfectly and the way Hermione studies frantically for her OWLs matches her character's personality so well. This book is so, so good, especially the battle in the Department of Mysteries, and I loved how Luna's character was added. Luna plays such an important role in this movie, explaining the thestrals and other things to Harry. Yes, I will admit it was long, but totally worth it!
    I like how there are some new characters, like Tonks, Luna and Umbridge.
    Makes it even better. 
    This book has lots of depth, and little (but relevant) details that are really satisfying later on if you pay attention. Does a good job with emotion too.
    My one slight disappointment is that no one killed Umbridge! J.K Rowling did such an excellent, fantastic job of making her totally horrible! 
    Dumbledore so should have let the Centaurs finish off the HIGH TOAD OF HOGWARTS, if you ask me, but then, I guess she was needed alive for the next book.</p>

<h2>3.Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban</h2>
<h3>Author:J.K.Rowling</h3>
<h4>Rating:</h4>
<p>I just finished reading "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" and I'm still reeling from the experience. J.K. Rowling's third installment in the Harry Potter series is, without a doubt, one of the most captivating and thrilling books I've ever had the pleasure of reading.

    The story is a masterclass in storytelling, weaving together complex plot threads, memorable characters, and stunning magical world-building. The introduction of Sirius Black, a wizard with a mysterious past, adds a layer of depth to the story that will keep you guessing until the very end.
    
    The pacing is expertly handled, with moments of high-stakes action and suspense balanced beautifully with moments of quiet reflection and character development. The themes of friendship, loyalty, and the power of love are woven throughout the narrative, making this book a truly unforgettable read.
    
    The writing is, as always, superb. Rowling's prose is evocative and immersive, transporting you to the world of Hogwarts with ease. The characters are richly drawn and complex, with even the minor players leaving a lasting impression.
    
    If you're a fan of the series, you won't want to miss this installment. If you're new to Harry Potter, this book is an excellent introduction to the magical world that has captured the hearts of millions.
    
    Overall, "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" is a must-read for anyone who loves fantasy, adventure, or simply a good story well-told.</p>

<h2>4.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows</h2>
<h3>Author:J.K.Rowling</h3>
<h4>Rating:3.8/5</h4>
<p>Excellent piece of writing by J.K Rowling. This book features all the needy things to be put in a series like this full of magic and suspense afterwards murders and finally not so happy ending. The book all starts will Harry Sighting professor Dumbeldore in the muggle world which soon is lead to an amazing adventure. As harry gets off the train with Luna who had hopefully spotted harry lying down with his blood bleeding lips under the invisibility cloak by Luna's Night vision goggles Harry hears new things from his friends about Lord Voldemort's hidden secrets, Draco's real identity, the death eaters on the loose, danger in the muggle world, Ron's old girlfriend tempering Hermione, Harry is looking for something from Ginny, Dumbeldore's amazing facts and pretty much more with a sad ending as Dumbeldore dies as an intention of him and severus. This book is really entertaining and one of the greatest. 
    Thanks again for the wonderful book by J.K Rowling!

<h2>5.Harry Potter and the chamber of secrets</h2>
<h3>Author:J.K.Rowling</h3>
<h4>Rating:4.1/5</h4>
<p>The second book in the Harry Potter series contains all of the exciting ingredients which made the first one such a success. Harry’s cruel treatment by the Dursley family continues, as does the kindness and support offered by Ron Weasley’s family. 

    The fantasy elements also abound, with the flying sequences arguably even more dramatic and fascinating than in Philosophers Stone. In the latter it was flying broomsticks, in Chamber of Secrets it is a flying car – a Ford Anglia belonging to Ron’s dad. 
    
    The flying car is an inspirational inclusion which many children will relate to. How many of us have clutched the steering wheel of the family car imagining we are flying an aeroplane? The flying Anglia reminded me of another great fictional creation in the 50’s comic ‘Eagle’ – ‘Dan Dare Pilot of the Future’. When Dan finally makes it to the planet Venus, he finds ‘flying chairs’ as the internal transport system in one of the planet’s biggest cities – Mekonta.
    
    The plot is similar to the first book – the discovery of a lethal force concealed in the Hogwarts building. It presents a serious threat to staff and pupils alike - ultimately, the story revolves around Harry’s bravery in eliminating the menace. It leads to many more characters and developments, many of them quite frightening. 
    
    The chamber is found to be the home of a basilisk – a giant snake with the power to kill people if they look at its reflection. Harry and Ron also encounter giant spiders reminiscent of the giant Martian war machines in H G Wells’sci-fi novel ‘The War of the Worlds’. 
    
    Some believe that children may find such aggressive monsters too frightening. I would argue that children should be aware of life’s more confronting areas – and the Harry Potter novels do this most effectively. Monsters never fail to fascinate us - look how long the Loch Ness legend has kept our attention.
    
    ‘Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets’ also continues to address several more social and behavioural issues -  Harry still suffers bullying by the Dursleys and the persecution of pupils who do not come from all magical families, is an obvious protest against racism. The dangers of acting upon unreliable information is another of the story’s messages.
    
    At a deeper psychological level, the narrative suggests that one’s character is the result of one’s choices – which overlooks the fact that choices are often made for you by circumstances. As usual, there is plenty to digest in Harry Potter. Above all ‘Harry Potter And The Chamber of Secrets’ is a top story full of imaginative and intriguing scenarios. It is as original and stimulating as the first – a pattern which I am assured continues throughout the whole series. I look forward to more to come</p>

<h2>6.Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</h2>
<h3>Author:J.K.Rowling</h3>
<h4>Rating:4.4/</h4>
<p>I just finished reading "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" by J.K. Rowling and I'm still reeling from the experience. The sixth book in the series is just as captivating as the others, but with a darker and more mature tone that sets it apart.

    The story is expertly woven, with intricate plot twists and character developments that keep you on the edge of your seat. The return of a mysterious potions textbook and a mysterious past student of Hogwarts sets Harry on a journey to uncover the truth about his own destiny, and it's not long before he's entangled in a web of danger and deceit.
    
    One of the standout aspects of this book is the way Rowling explores the complexities of teenage relationships. The romantic entanglements between Harry, Ron, and Hermione are relatable and heartbreaking, making it easy to become invested in their lives. Meanwhile, the mentorship between Harry and Dumbledore is both poignant and powerful.
    
    The themes of love, loss, and sacrifice are woven throughout the narrative, making for a rich and emotionally resonant reading experience. The writing is as evocative as ever, with vivid descriptions of Hogwarts and its magical world that transported me back to my own childhood fantasies.
    
    If I have any criticisms, it's that the pacing can be a bit uneven at times. Some sections feel a bit slow or predictable, while others are fast-paced and thrilling. However, these moments are few and far between, and overall, the book is a gripping and emotional ride that left me eager for the next installment.
    
    Overall, I highly recommend "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince" to anyone who's been following the series from the beginning. It's a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and world-building that will leave you breathless and craving more.</p>

<h2>7.Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h2>
<h3>Author:J.K.Rowling</h3>
<h4>Rating:4.2/5</h4>
<p>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is another classic in the franchise. Personally, I find it to be (in the best way possible) one of the more average novels in the series.

    The novel, for the most part, has amazing pacing. The opening is tremendously exciting, hyping the Quidditch World Cup up from the beginning. Of course, the quidditch match is perfectly paid off with the best written match of the series. Fast forwarding a bit, from the minute the Goblet of Fire itself is introduced, the novel continues with flawless pacing. Many new characters are introduced and I genuinely think all of them are amazing additions to the series (except for Winky who I thought was a bit overdone), Ludo Bagman was funny but had a good twist, Krum was entertaining, Fleur was interesting and more. I think just about every character was written to their full potential and I mean that honestly. The only problem is everything between the Quidditch World Cup and the Goblet of Fire spitting out the Triwizard Tournament contestants. The Death Eater chapter following the quidditch match was a bit rushed, all over the place and poorly written at times and I can understand why Rowling had such a hard time writing it because it was a difficult task, but just because it's difficult does not mean it's good. After that, the pacing becomes too slow for my taste and really struggles to keep the momentum and interest that the other parts of the novel do so flawlessly. Being a Harry Potter fan I love Quidditch. Quidditch is a sport in the wizarding world involving a lot of excitement and thrill. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire has the most humor and suspense in any book I've ever read. And also, it is the book with the Quidditch World Cup. The most thrilling things happened in this book, involving The Triwizard Tournament and the rising of Lord Voldemort. Besides, it is the first book that ever mentions the existence of Albus Dumbledore's pensieve. I would recommend this book to ages eight to twelve, even though it is definitely suitable for all ages. It is a book that would make you feel you couldn't put it down. A super read for all ages. The words are so sweet.I love all the harry Potter series very much.Once we start reading we can't stop to read because i was so eager to know what is the next situation.I recommend this book with a pleasure . The last part of the book when Cedric gets killed by Pettigrew was really sad because he was really brave , but I loved the book a lot it was amazing</p>

<p>Loving it.

<h2>9.Percy Jackson & the Lighting Thief</h2>
<h3>Author:Percy Jackson</h3>
<h4>Rating:4.5/5</h4>
<p>The Lighting Thief is the pilot novel in the series revolving around the life of a regular 12-year old boy, Percy who finds out he is the son of a Greek god. 

    From there, Percy, his friends Annabeth, Grover and his half-brother Tyson go on dangerous quests to stop a certain evil Titan from rising, by returning a lightening bolt to Zeus, the original wielder.
    
    Rick Riordan's sense of humor is absolutely phenomenal—and this is one of my favourite characteristics in this middle grade book. I'd recommend it for children above the age of eight, and I'm sure there aren't many who don't enjoy these light, fast paced reads!
    
    On the way he experiences betrayal, death and scary truths that don't always do him good, but this tale tells us that every one of us has a weak spot, and sometimes, even that can be your greatest strength. The lessons to learn from these stories are hidden in between the lines, and that is another wonderful characteristic that makes a great read!
    
    This story is fast-paced, so don't read it after a week if you've already started it. The first time I read this book, I lost my train of thought near the end and flew away with Grover's shoes so... don't do the same thing! The books are wonderfully written, in first person, and makes the perfect read for anyone who likes Harry Potter (if that's a bench mark.)
    
    Happy Reading!</p>

<h2>10.Gaban</h2>
<h3>Author:Munshi Premchand</h3>
<h4>Rating:4.6/5</h4>
<p>This piece of creation by Premchand probably his best work ; it depicts the innate and influenced nature of the societal humans of pre-independent India which was very much emotion and ambition driven . Morality and ethical values are deteriorating in erstwhile society which is very much relevant in the present society.
    I would say , Gaban would be must read for those who want to seek and experience the true Indian societal behaviour and ethics....</p>
